data:
  dataset_name: ../data/train_dataset
  # The name of the dataset to use.

  # Overwrite the cached training and evaluation sets
  preprocessing_num_workers: 
  # The number of processes to use for the preprocessing.

  # The maximum total input sequence length after tokenization. Sequences longer than this will be truncated, sequences shorter will be padded.
  pad_to_max_length: False
  # Whether to pad all samples to `max_seq_length`. If False, will pad the samples dynamically when batching to the maximum length in the batch (which can be faster on GPU but will be slower on TPU).
  doc_stride: 128
  # When splitting up a long document into chunks, how much stride to take between chunks.
  max_answer_length: 30
  # The maximum length of an answer that can be generated. This is needed because the start and end predictions are not conditioned on one another.

training:
  output_dir: ../models/baseline_batch_64

  # Whether to run training.
  do_eval: True
  # Whether to run eval on the dev set.
  per_device_train_batch_size: 64
